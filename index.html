    I went to 5 different schools from K-12. All the schools
    are in New Jersey. I am in 12th grade currently and the classes
    I'm taking right now are: Creative Foods, AP Microeconomics/Macroeconomics,
     Fine Art/Applied Art, Computer Science 4, Calculus, BCC English, and
    Study Hall. I am in a computer science program in high school but do not
     plan on majoring in computer science in college. I have above average grades
     and have plans on going to college.
