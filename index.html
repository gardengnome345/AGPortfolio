    I went to 5 different schools from K-12. All the schools
    are in New Jersey. I am in 12th grade currently and the classes
    I'm taking right now are: Creative Foods, AP Microeconomics/Macroeconomics,
     Fine Art/Applied Art, Computer Science 4, Calculus, BCC English, and
    Study Hall. I am in a computer science program in high school but do not
     plan on majoring in computer science in college. I have above average grades
     and have plans on going to college.

    Sports
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Soccer - I only did one season of soccer when I was around 6 and
        played for a recreational team that played a few games in the season. I liked
    playing on offense and scoring goals.
    <li>
    <li> Jiu Jitsu - I did jiu jitsu at a local place for around 2-3 years. I enjoyed it
          a lot and started around 4th grade and ended in the middle of 6th grade.
         I went to one tournament where I placed second and went to practice almost five
          times a week.
    <li>
    <li> Wrestling - Wrestling is the main sport of my life and I wrestled starting at a club
         in 7th grade and started wrestling for my school in 9th grade. I wrestled from 9-11
          and plan on wrestling in senior year.
    <li>
    <li> Cross Country - I only did XC for one year during 9th grade. It was my first high
         school sport that got me into HS sports and increased my stamina and endurance
           and had a lot of fun even though it was hard.
    <li>
    <li> Track and Field - I did track and field during my junior year in the spring. Not
          much to say about it, I did not have a lot of fun and it was boring. I don't
          mind having the experience.
  </ul>

    Work
  </h2>
  <p>
    I have worked 3 jobs:
    <ul>
      <li> Walgreens: Customer Service Associate - Helped customers and worked
            register most of the time and also worked on the floor. Was my first
            job that gave me a lot of experience which helped a lot.
      <li> Walmart: Online Shopper - Second job that I only had for 2 months,
            pay was better, but I did not have a good experience with the managers,
            and decided to quit.
      <li> Target: Fulfillment Expert - My third job so far which I currently do not have,
          I liked the managers and most of my coworkers, I just felt like it was too much
          for what my pay was and decided to quit after around 3 months even though
          I was a very good worker.
    </ul>
